# Predict-Stock-Price
Predict Apple stock price using different model

This is the code for the Stock Price Prediction challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #3' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a support vector regression on a stock price dataset from Google Finance to predict a future price. In the video, I use scikit-learn to build an ML model.
